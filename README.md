# Defend-Capture

## Purpose
**This game is a smallscale RTS game built on the Unity game engine for my final year project.**

it features an AI system that aids the player units fight and a enemy AI script that helps the enemy fight
there is a base building sub theme where the player must control building and resources to make their army
Tanks, Helicopter and infantry play a large game of rock paper scissors to counter each other.



The supervisor for the project was James Hayter.
